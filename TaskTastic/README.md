## **Issues**

Here are some ways you can make TaskTastic even better:

1. **Task Reordering**  
   Add a drag-and-drop feature to let users rearrange their task lists effortlessly.  

2. **Reminder Notifications**  
   Build a feature to send friendly reminders for upcoming tasks or deadlines.  

3. **Upgrade the Background**  
   Add some style! Maybe a gradient, a pattern, or even a toggle for light/dark modes to make the app look amazing.  

4. **Task Prioritization**  
   Add a “priority” feature so tasks can be color-coded (e.g., green for low, yellow for medium, red for high). It’ll help users focus on what’s urgent.  

5. **Clear All Button**  
   Create a “Clear All” button so users can clean up their completed tasks in one click.  

6. **Due Dates for Tasks**  
   Let users set due dates for tasks and send alerts when deadlines are close or overdue.
